Analysis Report for question_6850
============================================================

Goal: Measure of angle CFB
Expected value: 85.0°

Error: The proof doesn't uniquely determine angle CFB.
It could be 85.0° but also 50.0°

The proof needs additional constraints to uniquely determine this angle.

Analysis Report for question_6850
============================================================

You tried to find the goal angle CFB

In the premises you've had:
------------------------------------------------------------
Points:
  - C
  - F
  - B

Angles:
  - Angle BFC
  - Angle BCF
  - Angle CBF

Polygons:
  - Polygon BFC
  - Polygon BCF

These are the theorems that have to do with goal CFB in your proof:
------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2 - triangle_property_angle_sum(1, CFB):
  Conclusion: Equal(Add(MeasureOfAngle(CFB),MeasureOfAngle(FBC),MeasureOfAngle(BCF)),180)

Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. angle_BFC >= 0
2. angle_BFC <= 180
3. angle_BFC > 0
4. angle_BFC < 180
5. angle_BFC > 0
6. angle_BFC < 180
7. angle_BFC > 0
8. angle_BFC < 180
9. angle_BFC > 0
10. angle_BFC < 180
11. angle_BFC + angle_CBF + angle_BCF == 180

This wasn't enough information to get a unique value for the goal angle CFB.
Your proof allows multiple solutions for this angle.
It could be 85.0° but also 50.0°
You need to add more constraints by applying additional theorems.
