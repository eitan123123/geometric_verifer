Error: Solver constraints unsatisfiable. The geometric constraints are inconsistent.

Analysis Report for question_6760
============================================================

You tried to find the goal angle BAC

In the premises you've had:
------------------------------------------------------------
Points:
  - B
  - A
  - C

Angles:
  - Angle BAC

Polygons:
  - Polygon ACB
  - Polygon ABC

These are the theorems that have to do with goal BAC in your proof:
------------------------------------------------------------
Step 8 - arc_property_circumference_angle_external(1, OCB, A):
  Conclusion: Equal(MeasureOfAngle(BAC),Mul(MeasureOfArc(OCB),1/2))

Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. angle_BAC >= 0
2. angle_BAC <= 180
3. angle_BAC == arc_OBC*1/2

The solver found the constraints to be contradictory when trying to evaluate angle BAC.
This means there's an inconsistency in your geometric setup or theorem applications.
Check for contradictory premises or incorrectly applied theorems.
