Analysis Report for question_2141
============================================================

Goal expression: x
Expected value: 225.0

Variables related to this goal:
------------------------------------------------------------
- x

Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. angle_DBF == x

No theorems directly involving 'x' were found in your proof.

Diagnosis:
------------------------------------------------------------
The solver found the constraints to be contradictory. This means your proof contains
inconsistent constraints that cannot be satisfied simultaneously.

Possible causes:
1. Incorrect angle or length values in premises
2. Improper theorem application
3. Conclusions that contradict earlier assertions
4. Incorrect algebraic relationships between variables

Try checking your theorem applications, especially those relating directly to
the value of x, and verify that your premises are consistent.
