Analysis Report for question_4793
============================================================

You tried to find the goal angle DCA

In the premises you've had:
------------------------------------------------------------
Points:
  - D
  - C
  - A

Angles:
  - Angle ADC
  - Angle ACD

These are the theorems that have to do with goal DCA in your proof:
------------------------------------------------------------
None. Your proof doesn't include any theorems that constrain angle DCA.

This wasn't enough information to get a unique value for the goal angle DCA.
Your proof allows multiple solutions for this angle.
