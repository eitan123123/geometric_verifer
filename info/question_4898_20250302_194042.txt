============================================================

You tried to find the goal angle CAB

In the premises you've had:
------------------------------------------------------------
Points:
  - C
  - A
  - B

Angles:
  - Angle BAC

Polygons:
  - Polygon ACB
  - Polygon ABC

These are the theorems that have to do with goal CAB in your proof:
------------------------------------------------------------
None. Your proof doesn't include any theorems that constrain angle CAB.

This wasn't enough information to get a unique value for the goal angle CAB.
Your proof allows multiple solutions for this angle.
