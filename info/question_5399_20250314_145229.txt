Analysis Report for question_5399
============================================================

Goal: Measure of angle BOD
Expected value: 56.0°

Error: The proof doesn't uniquely determine angle BOD.
It could be 56.0° but also 56.50000001°

The proof needs additional constraints to uniquely determine this angle.

============================================================

You tried to find the goal angle BOD

In the premises you've had:
------------------------------------------------------------
Points:
  - B
  - O
  - D

Lines:
  - Line BO
  - Line DO
  - Line BD

Angles:
  - Angle BOD
  - Angle DBO

These are the theorems that have to do with goal BOD in your proof:
------------------------------------------------------------
None. Your proof doesn't include any theorems that constrain angle BOD.

Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. angle_BOD >= 0
2. angle_BOD <= 180
3. angle_BOD > 0
4. angle_BOD < 180
5. angle_BOD > 0
6. angle_BOD < 180

This wasn't enough information to get a unique value for the goal angle BOD.
Your proof allows multiple solutions for this angle.
It could be 56.0° but also 56.50000001°
You need to add more constraints by applying additional theorems.
