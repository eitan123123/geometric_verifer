============================================================

Goal: LengthOfLine(AC)
Expected value: 1.2

Error: The proof doesn't uniquely determine AC.
It could be 1.2 but also 4.0

Step 5 - line_addition(1, AB, BC):
  Conclusion: Equal(LengthOfLine(AC),Add(LengthOfLine(AB),LengthOfLine(BC)))

Solver constraints directly related to this line:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. length_AC >= 0
2. length_AC == length_AB + length_BC

Diagnosis:
------------------------------------------------------------
Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the length of line AC.
Multiple solutions are possible with the current constraints.
It could be Your answer: 1.2 but also 4.0
You need to add more constraints by applying additional theorems.
