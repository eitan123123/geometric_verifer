Analysis Report for question_4793
============================================================

Goal: Measure of angle DCA
Your answer: 50.0°

Error: The proof doesn't uniquely determine angle DCA.
It could be 50.0° but also 0.5°

The proof needs additional constraints to uniquely determine this angle.

Analysis Report for question_4793
============================================================

You tried to find the goal angle DCA

In the premises you've had:
------------------------------------------------------------
Points:
  - D
  - C
  - A

Angles:
  - Angle ADC
  - Angle ACD

These are the theorems that have to do with goal DCA in your proof:
------------------------------------------------------------
None. Your proof doesn't include any theorems that constrain angle DCA.

Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. angle_ACD > 0
2. angle_ACD <= 180
3. angle_ACD == angle_ACB
4. angle_ACD == angle_ACO
5. angle_ACD == angle_ACO
6. angle_ACD == angle_ACB

This wasn't enough information to get a unique value for the goal angle DCA.
Your proof allows multiple solutions for this angle.
It could be 50.0° but also 0.5°
You need to add more constraints by applying additional theorems.
