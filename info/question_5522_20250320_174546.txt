Analysis Report for question_5522
============================================================

Goal: Measure of angle BAC
Expected value: 28.0°

Error: The proof doesn't uniquely determine angle BAC.
It could be 28.0° but also 27.49999999°

The proof needs additional constraints to uniquely determine this angle.

Analysis Report for question_5522
============================================================

You tried to find the goal angle BAC

In the premises you've had:
------------------------------------------------------------
Points:
  - B
  - A
  - C

Lines:
  - Line AB
  - Line AC

Angles:
  - Angle ACB
  - Angle BAC
  - Angle ABC

Polygons:
  - Polygon ACB
  - Polygon ABC

These are the theorems that have to do with goal BAC in your proof:
------------------------------------------------------------
Step 6 - triangle_property_angle_sum(1, BAC):
  Conclusion: Equal(Add(MeasureOfAngle(BAC),MeasureOfAngle(ACB),MeasureOfAngle(CBA)),180)

Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. angle_BAC > 0
2. angle_BAC <= 180
3. angle_BAC == angle_BAD
4. angle_BAC == angle_BAD
5. angle_BAC + angle_ACB + angle_ABC == 180

This wasn't enough information to get a unique value for the goal angle BAC.
Your proof allows multiple solutions for this angle.
It could be 28.0° but also 27.49999999°
You need to add more constraints by applying additional theorems.
