Analysis Report for question_5510
============================================================

Goal: Sum of lines DN + DM
Expected value: 10.0

Analysis of line segments:
------------------------------------------------------------
Length of DN: 0.0
Length of DM: 0.0
Computed sum: DN + DM = 0.0

Error: Computed sum 0.0 doesn't match expected 10.0
This suggests an inconsistency between your proof and the expected answer.

Checking uniqueness of line lengths:
- Line DN is not uniquely determined (could also be 2.0)
- Line DM is not uniquely determined (could also be 2.0)

The sum DN + DM is not uniquely determined.
It could be 0.0 but also 0.0.
Alternative values: DN = 0.0, DM = 0.0

Geometric relationships that might explain this sum:
------------------------------------------------------------
No triangles found containing both lines.

Triangles containing either line:
- Triangle ADM contains line DM
- Triangle BND contains line DN
- Triangle AMD contains line DM
- Triangle ADN contains line DN
- Triangle CMD contains line DM (right triangle)
- Triangle CDM contains line DM
- Triangle BDN contains line DN
- Triangle AND contains line DN (right triangle)

Polygons containing these lines as sides:
- Polygon ADM contains 1 of the lines in the sum
- Polygon BND contains 1 of the lines in the sum
- Polygon ANDM contains 2 of the lines in the sum
- Polygon MABD contains 1 of the lines in the sum
- Polygon AMD contains 1 of the lines in the sum
- Polygon ADN contains 1 of the lines in the sum
- Polygon DCAN contains 1 of the lines in the sum
- Polygon NDMA contains 2 of the lines in the sum
- Polygon CMD contains 1 of the lines in the sum
- Polygon CAND contains 1 of the lines in the sum
- Polygon CDM contains 1 of the lines in the sum
- Polygon NDCA contains 1 of the lines in the sum
- Polygon ABDM contains 1 of the lines in the sum
- Polygon MAND contains 2 of the lines in the sum
- Polygon BDN contains 1 of the lines in the sum
- Polygon AND contains 1 of the lines in the sum
- Polygon DMAN contains 2 of the lines in the sum
- Polygon DMAB contains 1 of the lines in the sum
- Polygon ANDC contains 1 of the lines in the sum
- Polygon BDMA contains 1 of the lines in the sum

These lines might be part of the perimeter calculation for:
- Polygon ANDM
- Polygon NDMA
- Polygon MAND
- Polygon DMAN

Theorems related to lines DN and DM in your proof:
------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4 - right_triangle_judgment_angle(1, AND):
  Conclusion: RightTriangle(AND)

Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. length_DN >= 0
2. length_DM >= 0

Diagnosis:
------------------------------------------------------------
Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the sum DN + DM.
Multiple solutions are possible with the current constraints.
It could be 10.0 but also 0.0

You need to add more constraints by applying additional theorems.
Consider using theorems that fix the individual lengths of these lines,
such as the Pythagorean theorem, similar triangles, or other geometric relationships.
