Analysis Report for question_6660
============================================================

You tried to find the goal angle BCA

In the premises you've had:
------------------------------------------------------------
Points:
  - B
  - C
  - A

Angles:
  - Angle BAC
  - Angle ACB

Polygons:
  - Polygon ABC
  - Polygon ACB

These are the theorems that have to do with goal BCA in your proof:
------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4 - arc_property_circumference_angle_external(1, OAB, C):
  Conclusion: Equal(MeasureOfAngle(BCA),Mul(MeasureOfArc(OAB),1/2))

Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. angle_ACB > 0
2. angle_ACB <= 180
3. angle_ACB == arc_OAB*1/2

The solver found the constraints to be contradictory when trying to evaluate angle BCA.
This means there's an inconsistency in your geometric setup or theorem applications.
Check for contradictory premises or incorrectly applied theorems.
