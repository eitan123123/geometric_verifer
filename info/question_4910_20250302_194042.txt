============================================================

You tried to find the goal angle BAC

In the premises you've had:
------------------------------------------------------------
Points:
  - B
  - A
  - C

Angles:
  - Angle ACB
  - Angle BAC

Polygons:
  - Polygon ACB
  - Polygon ABC

These are the theorems that have to do with goal BAC in your proof:
------------------------------------------------------------
None. Your proof doesn't include any theorems that constrain angle BAC.

This wasn't enough information to get a unique value for the goal angle BAC.
Your proof allows multiple solutions for this angle.
