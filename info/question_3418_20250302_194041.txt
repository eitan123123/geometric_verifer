Analysis Report for question_3418
============================================================

You tried to find the goal angle GAE

In the premises you've had:
------------------------------------------------------------
Points:
  - G
  - A
  - E

Lines:
  - Line AE
  - Line AG

Angles:
  - Angle EAG

Polygons:
  - Polygon AGE
  - Polygon AEG

These are the theorems that have to do with goal GAE in your proof:
------------------------------------------------------------
Step 8 - angle_addition(1, GAE, EAD):
  Conclusion: Equal(MeasureOfAngle(GAD),Add(MeasureOfAngle(GAE),MeasureOfAngle(EAD)))

This wasn't enough information to get a unique value for the goal angle GAE.
Your proof allows multiple solutions for this angle.
