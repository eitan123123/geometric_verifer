Analysis Report for question_6802
============================================================

You tried to find the goal angle BAC

In the premises you've had:
------------------------------------------------------------
Points:
  - B
  - A
  - C

Lines:
  - Line BC

Angles:
  - Angle ACB
  - Angle ABC
  - Angle BAC

Polygons:
  - Polygon ACB
  - Polygon ABC

Perpendicular Lines:
  - Perpendicular BC and AC
  - Perpendicular AC and BC

Circles:
  - Circle B with center B

Cocircular Points:
  - Cocircular B,C

These are the theorems that have to do with goal BAC in your proof:
------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3 - triangle_property_angle_sum(1, ACB):
  Conclusion: Equal(Add(MeasureOfAngle(ACB),MeasureOfAngle(CBA),MeasureOfAngle(BAC)),180)

This wasn't enough information to get a unique value for the goal angle BAC.
Your proof allows multiple solutions for this angle.
