Analysis Report for question_5805
============================================================

Goal: Division of lines DE/BC
Expected value: 0.3333333333333333

Analysis of line segments:
------------------------------------------------------------
Length of DE: 0.3338890369
Length of BC: 1.001
Computed ratio: DE/BC = 0.33355548141858143

Error: Computed ratio 0.33355548141858143 doesn't match expected 0.3333333333333333
This suggests an inconsistency between your proof and the expected answer.

Checking uniqueness of line lengths:
- Line DE is not uniquely determined (could also be 0.25)
- Line BC is not uniquely determined (could also be 1.0)

The ratio DE/BC is not uniquely determined.
It could be 0.33355548141858143 but also 0.25.

Geometric relationships involving these line segments:
------------------------------------------------------------
- Lines BC and ED are parallel
- Lines CB and ED are parallel
- Lines BC and DE are parallel
- Lines CB and DE are parallel
- No perpendicular relationships found involving these lines

Triangles containing these lines:
- Triangle AED
- Triangle ABC
- Triangle ACB
- Triangle ADE

Similar triangles that may establish this ratio:
- Triangles ABC and ADE are similar
  (similarity ratio: 1.0)

Theorems related to lines DE and BC in your proof:
------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2 - parallel_property_corresponding_angle(1, DE, BC, A):
  Conclusion: Equal(MeasureOfAngle(ADE),MeasureOfAngle(DBC))

Step 4 - similar_triangle_judgment_aa(1, ADE, ABC):
  Conclusion: SimilarBetweenTriangle(ADE,ABC)

Step 5 - similar_triangle_property_line_ratio(1, ADE, ABC):
  Conclusion: Equal(LengthOfLine(DE),Mul(LengthOfLine(BC),RatioOfSimilarTriangle(ADE,ABC)))

Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. length_DE >= 0
2. length_BC >= 0
3. length_DE == length_BC*ratio_ADE_ABC
4. length_DE == length_BC*ratio_ADE_ABC

Diagnosis:
------------------------------------------------------------
Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the ratio DE/BC.
Multiple solutions are possible with the current constraints.
It could be 0.3333333333333333 but also 0.25

You need to add more constraints by applying additional theorems.
Consider using theorems about similar triangles, parallel lines,
or other geometric relationships that fix the proportion between these lines.
