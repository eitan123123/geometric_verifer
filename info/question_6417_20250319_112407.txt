Analysis Report for question_6417
============================================================

Goal: Sum of lines AC + BD
Expected value: 36.0

Analysis of line segments:
------------------------------------------------------------
Length of AC: 0.0
Length of BD: 0.0
Computed sum: AC + BD = 0.0

Error: Computed sum 0.0 doesn't match expected 36.0
This suggests an inconsistency between your proof and the expected answer.

Checking uniqueness of line lengths:
- Line AC is not uniquely determined (could also be 0.50000001)
- Line BD is not uniquely determined (could also be 0.50000001)

The sum AC + BD is not uniquely determined.
It could be 0.0 but also 0.0.
Alternative values: AC = 0.0, BD = 0.0

Geometric relationships that might explain this sum:
------------------------------------------------------------
No triangles found containing both lines.

Triangles containing either line:
- Triangle BDC contains line BD
- Triangle BCD contains line BD
- Triangle ABD contains line BD
- Triangle ACB contains line AC
- Triangle ACD contains line AC
- Triangle ADB contains line BD
- Triangle ADC contains line AC
- Triangle ABC contains line AC

Polygons containing these lines as sides:
- Polygon BDC contains 1 of the lines in the sum
- Polygon BCD contains 1 of the lines in the sum
- Polygon ABD contains 1 of the lines in the sum
- Polygon ACB contains 1 of the lines in the sum
- Polygon ACD contains 1 of the lines in the sum
- Polygon ADB contains 1 of the lines in the sum
- Polygon ADC contains 1 of the lines in the sum
- Polygon ABC contains 1 of the lines in the sum

Theorems related to lines AC and BD in your proof:
------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 - line_addition(1, AO, OC):
  Conclusion: Equal(LengthOfLine(AC),Add(LengthOfLine(AO),LengthOfLine(OC)))

Step 2 - line_addition(1, BO, OD):
  Conclusion: Equal(LengthOfLine(BD),Add(LengthOfLine(BO),LengthOfLine(OD)))

Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. length_AC >= 0
2. length_AC == length_AO + length_CO
3. length_BD >= 0
4. length_BD == length_BO + length_DO

Diagnosis:
------------------------------------------------------------
Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the sum AC + BD.
Multiple solutions are possible with the current constraints.
It could be 36.0 but also 0.0

You need to add more constraints by applying additional theorems.
Consider using theorems that fix the individual lengths of these lines,
such as the Pythagorean theorem, similar triangles, or other geometric relationships.
