============================================================

Goal: LengthOfLine(AC)
Expected value: 6.0

Error: The proof doesn't uniquely determine AC.
It could be 6.0 but also 0.0

Points:
  - A
  - C

Related Lines:
  - Line AD
  - Line BC

Triangles Containing This Line:
  - Triangle ACB
  - Triangle ABC

  - Triangle ADC

Theorems related to line AC in your proof:
------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5 - sine_theorem(1, ADC):
  Conclusion: Equal(Mul(LengthOfLine(AD),Sin(MeasureOfAngle(ADC))),Mul(LengthOfLine(AC),Sin(MeasureOfAngle(DCA))))

Solver constraints directly related to this line:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. length_AC >= 0
2. sin_DAB*length_AC == sin_ABD*length_BC

Diagnosis:
------------------------------------------------------------
Your proof doesn't uniquely determine the length of line AC.
Multiple solutions are possible with the current constraints.
It could be 6.0 but also 0.0
You need to add more constraints by applying additional theorems.
