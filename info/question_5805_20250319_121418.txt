Analysis Report for question_5805
============================================================

Goal: Division of lines DE/BC
Expected value: 0.3333333333333333

Analysis of line segments:
------------------------------------------------------------
Length of DE: 0.0
Length of BC: 0.0
Error: Division by zero - line BC has length approximately 0
This creates a mathematical error when computing the ratio.

Checking uniqueness of line lengths:
- Line DE is not uniquely determined (could also be 2.0)
- Line BC is not uniquely determined (could also be 6.0)
Error evaluating line lengths: cannot access local variable 'computed_value' where it is not associated with a value

Geometric relationships involving these line segments:
------------------------------------------------------------
- Lines ED and BC are parallel
- Lines DE and CB are parallel
- Lines ED and CB are parallel
- Lines CB and DE are parallel
- Lines BC and DE are parallel
- Lines CB and ED are parallel
- Lines BC and ED are parallel
- Lines DE and BC are parallel
- No perpendicular relationships found involving these lines

Triangles containing these lines:
- Triangle ACB
- Triangle AED
- Triangle ADE
- Triangle ABC

Similar triangles that may establish this ratio:
- Triangles ABC and ADE are similar
  (similarity ratio: 0.3333333333)

Theorems related to lines DE and BC in your proof:
------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2 - parallel_property_corresponding_angle(1, DE, BC, A):
  Conclusion: Equal(MeasureOfAngle(ADE),MeasureOfAngle(DBC))

Step 4 - similar_triangle_judgment_aa(1, ADE, ABC):
  Conclusion: SimilarBetweenTriangle(ADE,ABC)

Step 5 - similar_triangle_property_line_ratio(1, ADE, ABC):
  Conclusion: Equal(LengthOfLine(DE),Mul(LengthOfLine(BC),RatioOfSimilarTriangle(ADE,ABC)))

Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. length_DE >= 0
2. length_BC >= 0
3. length_DE == length_BC*ratio_ADE_ABC
4. length_DE == length_BC*ratio_ADE_ABC

Diagnosis:
------------------------------------------------------------
The geometric constraints in your proof don't allow the ratio DE/BC to be 0.3333333333333333.
This means your proof implies a different ratio than expected.

Check that:
1. Your line length values are correctly specified
2. You've correctly identified the lines in question
3. Your theorems about proportions or ratios are correctly applied

ERROR: Division by zero detected. Line BC has length approximately 0.
