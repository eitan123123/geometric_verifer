Analysis Report for question_4254
============================================================

You tried to find the goal angle CBP

In the premises you've had:
------------------------------------------------------------
Points:
  - C
  - B
  - P

Angles:
  - Angle CBP

Polygons:
  - Polygon BPC
  - Polygon BCP

These are the theorems that have to do with goal CBP in your proof:
------------------------------------------------------------
None. Your proof doesn't include any theorems that constrain angle CBP.

This wasn't enough information to get a unique value for the goal angle CBP.
Your proof allows multiple solutions for this angle.
