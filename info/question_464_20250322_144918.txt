============================================================

Goal: Length of arc PCY
Your answer: 66.0

Arc PCY is defined in the system.
Current measure of arc PCY: 60.0Â°

Circle P has a defined radius.
Radius of circle P: 0.0
Computed arc length: 0.0
This doesn't match Your answer: 66.0.

Theorems related to arc PCY in your proof:
------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 - arc_property_center_angle(1, PCY, P):
  Conclusion: Equal(MeasureOfArc(PCY),MeasureOfAngle(YPC))

Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. arc_PCY >= 0
2. arc_PCY <= 360
3. arc_PCY == 3*x - 3
4. arc_PCY == angle_CPY

Diagnosis:
------------------------------------------------------------
The geometric constraints in your proof uniquely determine the arc length of PCY to be None, not Your answer:66.0.
This means your proof leads to a different value than your submitted answer.

Check that:
1. Your arc measure and radius values are correctly specified
2. You've correctly identified the arc in question
3. Your calculations are accurate
