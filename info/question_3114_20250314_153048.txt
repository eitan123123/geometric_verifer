Analysis Report for question_3114
============================================================

Goal: Measure of angle DPA
Expected value: 30.0°

Error: The proof doesn't uniquely determine angle DPA.
It could be 30.0° but also 0.0°

The proof needs additional constraints to uniquely determine this angle.

Analysis Report for question_3114
============================================================

You tried to find the goal angle DPA

In the premises you've had:
------------------------------------------------------------
Points:
  - D
  - P
  - A

Angles:
  - Angle DAP
  - Angle APD
  - Angle ADP

Polygons:
  - Polygon APD
  - Polygon ADP

These are the theorems that have to do with goal DPA in your proof:
------------------------------------------------------------
Step 10 - triangle_property_angle_sum(1, ADP):
  Conclusion: Equal(Add(MeasureOfAngle(ADP),MeasureOfAngle(DPA),MeasureOfAngle(PAD)),180)

Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. angle_APD >= 0
2. angle_APD <= 180
3. angle_APD == angle_BPD
4. angle_APD == angle_DPO
5. angle_APD == angle_DPO
6. angle_APD == angle_BPD
7. angle_ADP + angle_APD + angle_DAP == 180

This wasn't enough information to get a unique value for the goal angle DPA.
Your proof allows multiple solutions for this angle.
It could be 30.0° but also 0.0°
You need to add more constraints by applying additional theorems.
