Analysis Report for question_1975
============================================================

Goal: Measure of angle DEC
Expected value: 100.0°

Error: Your answer was 100.0°, but the proof uniquely determines angle DEC to be 95.0°
The geometric constraints lead to a different value than your submitted answer.

Analysis Report for question_1975
============================================================

You tried to find the goal angle DEC

In the premises you've had:
------------------------------------------------------------
Points:
  - D
  - E
  - C

Angles:
  - Angle CED
  - Angle CDE
  - Angle DCE

Polygons:
  - Polygon CED
  - Polygon CDE

These are the theorems that have to do with goal DEC in your proof:
------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 - triangle_property_angle_sum(1, CDE):
  Conclusion: Equal(Add(MeasureOfAngle(CDE),MeasureOfAngle(DEC),MeasureOfAngle(ECD)),180)

Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. angle_CED > 0
2. angle_CED <= 180
3. angle_CED > 0
4. angle_CED < 180
5. angle_CED > 0
6. angle_CED < 180
7. angle_CED > 0
8. angle_CED < 180
9. angle_CED > 0
10. angle_CED < 180
11. angle_CDE + angle_CED + angle_DCE == 180

The constraints in your proof uniquely determine angle DEC to be 95.0°, not 100.0°.
This means your proof leads to a different value than your submitted answer.
