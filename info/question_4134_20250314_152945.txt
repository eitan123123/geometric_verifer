Goal: Cosine of angle BCD
Expected value: 0.8

Found 6 triangle(s) containing angle BCD:
- Triangle ACB
- Triangle BCD
  (This is a right triangle)
- Triangle ACD
- Triangle ADC
  (This is a right triangle)
- Triangle ABC
  (This is a right triangle)
- Triangle BDC

Side AC = 8.0
Side CB = 6.0
Side AB = 10.0

Triangle sides are uniquely determined.
Calculated cos(BCD) = 0.0 using Law of Cosines

Error: Calculated cosine value 0.0 doesn't match expected 0.8
Current value of angle BCD = 0.0°
Angle BCD is not uniquely determined - could also be 1.0°
Your proof needs more constraints to fix this angle to a specific value.

Theorems related to angle BCD in your proof:
------------------------------------------------------------
Step 10 - sine_theorem(1, DBC):
  Conclusion: Equal(Mul(LengthOfLine(DB),Sin(MeasureOfAngle(DBC))),Mul(LengthOfLine(DC),Sin(MeasureOfAngle(BCD))))

Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. angle_BCD >= 0
2. angle_BCD <= 180

Diagnosis:
------------------------------------------------------------
The geometric constraints in your proof don't allow cos(BCD) to be 0.8.
This means your proof implies a different cosine value than expected.

Check that:
1. Your triangle side lengths are correctly specified
2. You've correctly identified the angle in question
3. There are no errors in your angle constraints
