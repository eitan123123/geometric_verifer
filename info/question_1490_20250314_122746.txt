Analysis Report for question_1490
============================================================

Goal: Measure of angle FAB
Expected value: 131.0°

Error: The proof doesn't uniquely determine angle FAB.
It could be 131.0° but also 131.50000001°

The proof needs additional constraints to uniquely determine this angle.

============================================================

You tried to find the goal angle FAB

In the premises you've had:
------------------------------------------------------------
Points:
  - F
  - A
  - B

Lines:
  - Line AB

Angles:
  - Angle AFB
  - Angle BAF
  - Angle ABF

Polygons:
  - Polygon AFB
  - Polygon ABF

These are the theorems that have to do with goal FAB in your proof:
------------------------------------------------------------
None. Your proof doesn't include any theorems that constrain angle FAB.

Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. angle_BAF >= 0
2. angle_BAF <= 180
3. angle_BAF == angle_BAC
4. angle_BAF == angle_BAC

This wasn't enough information to get a unique value for the goal angle FAB.
Your proof allows multiple solutions for this angle.
It could be 131.0° but also 131.50000001°
You need to add more constraints by applying additional theorems.
