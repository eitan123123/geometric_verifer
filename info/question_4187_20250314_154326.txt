Analysis Report for question_4187
============================================================

Goal: Sine of angle BAC
Expected value: 0.5

Found 2 triangle(s) containing angle BAC:
- Triangle ABC
- Triangle ACB

Error analyzing triangle sides: 'ArithRef' object has no attribute 'as_decimal'
Current value of angle BAC = 0.0°
Angle BAC is not uniquely determined - could also be 1.0°
Your proof needs more constraints to fix this angle to a specific value.

Found direct sine variable: sin_BAC
Current value of sin(BAC) = 0.0
The sine value is not uniquely determined - could also be 0.5

Theorems related to angle BAC in your proof:
------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1 - sine_theorem(1, BAC):
  Conclusion: Equal(Mul(LengthOfLine(BA),Sin(MeasureOfAngle(BAC))),Mul(LengthOfLine(BC),Sin(MeasureOfAngle(ACB))))

Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. angle_BAC >= 0
2. angle_BAC <= 180
3. sin_BAC >= 0
4. sin_BAC <= 1
5. length_AB*sin_ACB == length_BC*sin_BAC

Diagnosis:
------------------------------------------------------------
Your proof doesn't uniquely determine sin(BAC).
Multiple solutions are possible with the current constraints.
It could be 0.5 but also 0.0

You need to add more constraints by applying additional theorems.
Focus on fixing the shape of the triangle containing this angle.
