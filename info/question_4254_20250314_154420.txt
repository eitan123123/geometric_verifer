Analysis Report for question_4254
============================================================

Goal: Measure of angle CBP
Expected value: 45.0°

Error: The proof doesn't uniquely determine angle CBP.
It could be 45.0° but also 45.50000001°

The proof needs additional constraints to uniquely determine this angle.

Analysis Report for question_4254
============================================================

You tried to find the goal angle CBP

In the premises you've had:
------------------------------------------------------------
Points:
  - C
  - B
  - P

Angles:
  - Angle BPC
  - Angle BCP
  - Angle CBP

Polygons:
  - Polygon BPC
  - Polygon BCP

These are the theorems that have to do with goal CBP in your proof:
------------------------------------------------------------
None. Your proof doesn't include any theorems that constrain angle CBP.

Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. angle_CBP >= 0
2. angle_CBP <= 180
3. angle_CBP == angle_ABC
4. angle_CBP == angle_ABC

This wasn't enough information to get a unique value for the goal angle CBP.
Your proof allows multiple solutions for this angle.
It could be 45.0° but also 45.50000001°
You need to add more constraints by applying additional theorems.
