Analysis Report for question_2765
============================================================

You tried to find the goal angle EZD

In the premises you've had:
------------------------------------------------------------
Points:
  - E
  - Z
  - D

Angles:
  - Angle DEZ
  - Angle DZE
  - Angle EDZ

These are the theorems that have to do with goal EZD in your proof:
------------------------------------------------------------
None. Your proof doesn't include any theorems that constrain angle EZD.

This wasn't enough information to get a unique value for the goal angle EZD.
Your proof allows multiple solutions for this angle.
