Analysis Report for question_3298
============================================================

Goal: Measure of angle OAB
Expected value: 10.0°

Error: The proof doesn't uniquely determine angle OAB.
It could be 10.0° but also 10.25000001°

The proof needs additional constraints to uniquely determine this angle.

Analysis Report for question_3298
============================================================

You tried to find the goal angle OAB

In the premises you've had:
------------------------------------------------------------
Points:
  - O
  - A
  - B

Lines:
  - Line BO

Angles:
  - Angle ABO
  - Angle BAO

Polygons:
  - Polygon AOB
  - Polygon ABO

These are the theorems that have to do with goal OAB in your proof:
------------------------------------------------------------
Step 6 - angle_addition(1, CAO, OAB):
  Conclusion: Equal(MeasureOfAngle(CAB),Add(MeasureOfAngle(CAO),MeasureOfAngle(OAB)))

Solver constraints directly related to this goal:
------------------------------------------------------------
1. angle_BAO > 0
2. angle_BAO <= 180

This wasn't enough information to get a unique value for the goal angle OAB.
Your proof allows multiple solutions for this angle.
It could be 10.0° but also 10.25000001°
You need to add more constraints by applying additional theorems.
