Analysis Report for question_2851
============================================================

You tried to find the goal angle DOA

In the premises you've had:
------------------------------------------------------------
Points:
  - D
  - O
  - A

Lines:
  - Line AO

Angles:
  - Angle ADO
  - Angle DAO
  - Angle AOD

Polygons:
  - Polygon ADO
  - Polygon AOD

These are the theorems that have to do with goal DOA in your proof:
------------------------------------------------------------
None. Your proof doesn't include any theorems that constrain angle DOA.

This wasn't enough information to get a unique value for the goal angle DOA.
Your proof allows multiple solutions for this angle.
